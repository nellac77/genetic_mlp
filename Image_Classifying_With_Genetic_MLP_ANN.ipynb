    "### Applying this to the ANN\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the article, we will perform the image classifying with a fully connected MLP ANN. The ANN will have the following properties adjusted by the genetic algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ number of layers\n",
    "+ number of neurons per layer\n",
    "+ dense layer activation function\n",
    "+ network optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to employing the gentic algorithm with this network are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize *N* random networks to create our population.\n",
    "2. Score each network. This takes some time: We have to train the weights of each network and then see how well it performs at classifying the test set. Since this will be an image classification task, we’ll use classification accuracy as our fitness function.\n",
    "3. Sort all the networks in our population by score (accuracy). We’ll keep some percentage of the top networks to become part of the next generation and to breed children.\n",
    "4. Rrandomly keep a few of the non-top networks. This helps find potentially lucky combinations between worse-performers and top performers, and also helps keep us from getting stuck in a local maximum.\n",
    "5. Now that we’ve decided which networks to keep, we randomly mutate some of the parameters on some of the networks.\n",
    "6. Here comes the fun part: Let’s say we started with a population of 20 networks, we kept the top 25% (5 nets), randomly kept 3 more loser networks, and mutated a few of them. We let the other 12 networks die. In an effort to keep our population at 20 networks, we need to fill 12 open spots. It’s time to breed!\n",
